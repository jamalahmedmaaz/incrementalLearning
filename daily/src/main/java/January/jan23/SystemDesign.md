Design Principles:

1. Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from 
what stays the same.
2. Program to interface not an implementation.
3. Favor composition over inheritance.
4. Strive for loosely coupled design between objects that interact.
5. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
6. Depend upon abstractions, do not depend upon concrete classes.
7. Principle of least Knowledge - talk only to your immediate friend.
8. Hollywood principle - don't call us we will call you.
9. A class should have one reason to change.
