     * Tell me about the time you failed and what did you learn from it/prevent from happening again?
     *
     * Situation: Product was about to get released in 2 weeks and the customer/partner backed out?
     *
     * Task: Identify other customer and partners within the org and also use existing companies data to
     * to validate the product reliablity (doesnt what is suppose to do).
     *
     * Action: Multiple calls with different customers offering them service with discounts and other related
     * features.
     *
     * Result: Delivered the product and got and great NPS response. "Learned never to assume on data"
     *
     * Failure: Didnt deliver on time. "For me it is a failure"? At crucial point of before releasing
     * we got to know our partner went with our competitor. Which cost us few days, to make new partnership
     * with another existing customer to get there data and validate it is solving the problem (matching)
     * as customer expects.
     *
     * Take Aways:
     * Our big problem was assuming that we would be able to get clean data from users.
     * It’s one of my biggest takeaways from the experience: Never make assumptions about the data.
     * I haven’t made that mistake again.

    /**
     * Tell me about a time you made a mistake?
     *
     * Situation: Was making migration on existing database for a live service to improve and better the
     * service and did a coding mistake/crime of using inner queries for inserting into other table.
     *
     * Task: Fix the issue.
     *
     * Action: Fixed the issue with remove that kind of query with pulling data from table and processing
     * and in-memory and then writing to the other table. (later improved the service by doing lot of improvement).
     *
     * Result/Outcome: Service got delivered correctly within 3 hours. Normal traffic was not effected, because
     * of the feature flag introduced during the first cycle of development. Need to send this to production fast.
     * because marketing team was waiting.

     * Less bugs and better customer communication started.
